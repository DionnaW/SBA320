# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# firstREACTsba


starting my 320 sba today, which will be a login page that goes to a profile page where customers will be able to book my services fro their special event
I plan on using this for my capstone project
I installed react and the app is running
I installed react-router-dom and fullcalendar, fullcalendar/timegrid, and fullcalendar/interaction for functionality of my calendar
I installed firebase for authentication for usernames and passwords storage
App is running with minimal usability issues because i didn't finish with firebase
Configured my firebase atuh, set nav, and welcome pages
I finally have my firebase auth codes working for creat an account and upon entering a successful email will lead to login page
Installed bootstrap and react-bootstrap for styling
created .evn file for firebase, because i kept getting secret warnings from github for exposing my google api
still trying to find a free calendar api but app is still running so i'll commit just to commit
have my login.jsx functuality working without errors
i think the project is complete! waiting to speak with the teacher then i will commit and submit
having firebase errors at deploy checking to see if importing the firebase config will cure this issue
